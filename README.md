# Instructions

Use this repo. Copy your files from the previous homework into this repo, making any improvements you need. (Yes, I know this isn't the best way to do version control.) Make sure that you don't accidentally copy the `.git` folder over when moving files.

## Launch Docker
Using the Docker config files in this repo, launch Docker and view your new web site. Practice this, as we'll be doing it often.

## `.dockerignore` File
Read the following [explaition of the `.dockerignore` file](https://blog.codeship.com/leveraging-the-dockerignore-file-to-create-smaller-images/)
Create a `.dockerignore` file with at least the following. Be able to explain what each line does.

```
.*
docker-compose.yml
*.md
```

## A simple Javascript
Add a script to your project to make the table sortable (on your page with the table).

You may use any table sort script on the web. Here are two to get your search started:

* http://tristen.ca/tablesort/demo/
* https://github.hubspot.com/sortable/docs/welcome/ (I think I like this one better.)

The ideal script "just works", perhaps with simply adding only a class to your table.
